Title:
Pakistan is not available in the Country Dropdown

Browser:
Chrome

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure the Pakistan's IP or use VPN and select Pakistan.
2. Go to https://www.videoslots.com/
3. Click Open Account.

Actual Result:
I am seeing country code as 92 but I am not seeing Pakistan as country in the country dropdown. This might be happening for
other countries as well.

Expected Result:
If I am seeing country code as 92 then I should see Pakistan as country in the country dropdown. If this website is not
for Pakistan then it should not be accessible by IPs from Pakistan.

Why Critical?
It is critical because if there is not country available in the country dropdown then user won't be able to register on
the website. Becasue, country is a mandatory field which we need upon registration to see the demographcis of the
customers.
